      Your teen is going to say something along the lines of it being too hard to drive. A manual car is known for the fact that it does come with a bigger learning curve compared to their automatic counterparts (“Driving”). But with an arsenal of ways to learn how to drive a manual car—videos, driving schools, instructions, yourself—and a little persistence, the teen should be able to learn within a week. Personally, when I first started to learn, I constantly stalled. One time at Walmart, I stalled my car nine times in a row before getting on the road again. That was when I first started to drive, but with help from my dad and online youtube tutorials, I was able to get on the road without stalling within the next week. I was able to learn how to drive the manual car within a week because I constantly had practice.
